# EEE-304-Smart-payment-system
This project implements a smart payment system using basic logic gates. It calculates and processes payments using the gates and displays the results on an Arduino-controlled LCD display.

"Smart Booth for Payment" is a project that calculates the total cost of products (A, B, and C) based on customer input for quantity and money given. It then computes and displays the change to be returned. Additionally, the project includes a decimal-to-binary converter using Simulino (Arduino Uno), a number pad, and an LCD display in Proteus, and a binary-to-BCD converter for digital display in decimal format.
